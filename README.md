# Introduction 
This is a small rendering framework for vulkan with the ability to load various gltf/obj/fbx objects, render them and to manually place lights within the scene.

# Main features:
This renderer is able to load multiple formats for 3D models including those with embedded textures. It also has a couple "fail safe" texture to hopefully allow you to load a model even without any textures.
It uses assimp and should be able to load a majority of the formats that assimp can.

The project has deffered rendering with directional lights and point lights implemented. There is also on boot shader loading. So you can quickly re-load your scenes after making changes. It uses physical camera simulation.
Which can be setup within the blitShader.

It has pbr texture support, for normals. metallic and roughness and obviously albedo (No AO support :/)

# Conclusion
Well after that short main features chapter we already reached the conclusion. I had lots of fun working on this project! I might even keep working on it after this and hopefully add all the things I dint have time for.
